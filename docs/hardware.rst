Hardware
========

The acoustic startle response setup can only record data, if the required hardware is available.

Soundcard
---------

The soundcard should have at least **two** output channels. If two different loudspeakers for pre-stimulus and  startle-stimulus
should be used, the soundcard needs at least **three** channels:

- trigger channel
- pre stimulus
- startle stimulus

In our setup we use a *Asus Xonar STX II* soundcard.
